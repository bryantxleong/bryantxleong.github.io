		<p>“Kamen Rider Faiz” is a Platformer game featuring three levels.</p>
		<p>In the third level, players encounter a boss, and the game ends once the boss is defeated.</p>

		<p>This project was created as my final assignment for the first semester.
		It was fully developed using Stencyl, allowing me to practice level design, platformer mechanics, and basic game development.</p>
