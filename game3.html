				<H3>Game Intro</H3>
					<p>“Kamen Rider Faiz” is a Platformer game featuring three levels.</p>
					<p>Players can perform close-range attacks, long-range attacks, and the signature Rider Kick.</p>
					<p>In the third level, a boss appears, and the game concludes once it is defeated.</p>
					<p>This project was created as my final assignment for the first semester, 
						which required all game assets including backgrounds, 
						characters and animations to be created from scratch in Photoshop.
					</p>
					<p>The game was fully developed using Stencyl, giving me the opportunity to practice level design, 
						platformer mechanics, basic pixel art, and the fundamentals of game development.

				<H2>Challenging</H2>
				<p>While implementing the special attack “Rider Kick” for Kamen Rider, I encountered several technical issues.
				</p>
				
				<H4>1. Attack State Not Registering</H4>
				<p>The Rider Kick could not kill the enemy after hitting them. 
					In cases where it missed, the character became stuck in the Rider Kick state, preventing the game from continuing.
				</p>
				
				<H4>Solution</H4>
				<p>This happened because pressing the attack button switched the animation but did not actually enter the attack state. 
					I added a condition so that when the animation switches, the game also recognizes the character as being in an attack state. 
					Once the attack succeeds or fails, the state is cleared properly.</p>

				<H4>2. Endless Attack Spam</H4>
				<p>When the player pressed the attack button repeatedly, the character would continuously chase the enemy. 
					This was because the attack condition kept toggling without interruption, 
					and the specific speed assigned during the attack was refreshed continuously.
				</p>

				<H4>Solution</H4>
				<p>I added another condition to address this issue. To prevent players from spamming the attack button, 
					I applied a "Do After" method: 
				</p>
				<p>Once the attack button is pressed, it becomes inactive for one second before it can be used again.
