		<p>“MegamanX Shoot 'Em Up” is a Shoot ‘Em Up game with two levels.</p>
		<p>The first level is a normal mode, lasting around 2 minutes, ending when the boss is defeated.</p>
		<p>The second level is an endless mode, where players must keep defeating enemies until their life reaches zero.</p>

		<p>This project was created as part of a school assignment and fully developed using Stencyl, 
		\giving me experience in building game mechanics and level design.</p>

			<H2>Challenging</H2>
			<H4>Character Upgrade Challenge</H4>
			<p>One of the most difficult challenges during development was 
				figuring out how to make players clearly distinguish which character they were controlling.</p>
			<p>Another challenge was showing whether the character had been powered up, 
				along with the corresponding visual changes for each state.</p>
			
			<H4>Solution</H4>
			<p>Instead of making the original character disappear and creating a brand-new one, 
				I decided to use the same character actor and simply switch to a new animation. </p>
			<p>This approach kept the gameplay smooth while still making the power-up state visually clear to the players.</p>
			<p>To implement this, I created two separate booleans corresponding to the two different power-up states. </p>
			<p>When the character collected Power-up A, the normal attack mode would be disabled and replaced with the power-up attack. </p>
			<p>Once the power-up duration ended, the character reverted back to the normal state while disabling the power-up attack.</p>
			<p>The same logic was applied to Power-up B as well. </p>
