		<p>“MegamanX Shoot 'Em Up” is a Shoot ‘Em Up game with two levels.</p>
		<p>The first level is a normal mode, lasting around 2 minutes, ending when the boss is defeated.</p>
		<p>The second level is an endless mode, where players must keep defeating enemies until their life reaches zero.</p>

		<p>This project was created as part of a school assignment and fully developed using Stencyl, 
		\giving me experience in building game mechanics and level design.</p>
