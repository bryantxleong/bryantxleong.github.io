			<p>“Pikachu vs Raichu” is a two-player Pong-style game.</p>
			
			<p>In this game, two players compete against each other in a fast-paced match, 
				controlling Pikachu and Raichu as paddles to hit the ball back and forth.
				The objective of the game is simple: the first player to reach 15 points wins the match.</p>

			<p>This project was created as part of a school assignment and marks the first game I developed on my own.
				It was fully built using Stencyl, giving me the opportunity to explore the fundamentals of game development.</p>

			<H2>Challenging</H2>
			<H4>1. Spike Speed Boost Conflict</H4>
			<p>In the Pong game, giving the ball a speed boost when hitting a spike is a common gameplay mechanic.</p>
			<p>During development, although I implemented the functionality for the ball to speed up upon hitting a spike, 
				testing the game revealed that the feature did not work as expected.</p>
			
			<H4>Solution</H4>
			<p>After exploring Stencyl further, I realized that to trigger a continuous event.</p>
			<p>Such as </p>
			<p>“the ball hits a spike → spike disappears → ball speeds up”</p>
			<p>All related logic must be handled within the same actor. </p>
			<p>In my original code, I coded the spike to disappear when hitting by ball, and separately coded the ball to speed up when hitting a spike.
				This caused a conflict, as Stencyl could not determine which action to execute first: The spike disappearing or The ball speeding up.</p>
