		<p>“Pikachu vs Raichu” is a two-player Pong-style game.</p>
			
		<p>In this game, two players compete against each other in a fast-paced match, 
			controlling Pikachu and Raichu as paddles to hit the ball back and forth.
			The objective of the game is simple: the first player to reach 15 points wins the match.</p>

		<p>This project was created as part of a school assignment and marks the first game I developed on my own.
			It was fully built using Stencyl, giving me the opportunity to explore the fundamentals of game development.</p>
