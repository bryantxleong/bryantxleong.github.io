		<p>“Pikachu vs Raichu” is a two-player Pong-style game.</p>
			
		<p>In this game, two players compete against each other in a fast-paced match, 
			controlling Pikachu and Raichu as paddles to hit the ball back and forth.
			The objective of the game is simple: the first player to reach 15 points wins the match.</p>

		<p>This project was created as part of a school assignment and marks the first game I developed on my own.
			It was fully built using Stencyl, giving me the opportunity to explore the fundamentals of game development.</p>

		<H2>Challenging</H2>
		<H4>1. Spike Speed Boost Conflict</H4>
		<p>In the Pong game, giving the ball a speed boost when hitting a spike is a common gameplay mechanic.</p>
		<p>During development, although I implemented the functionality for the ball to speed up upon hitting a spike, 
			testing the game revealed that the feature did not work as expected.</p>
		
		<H4>Solution</H4>
		<p>After exploring Stencyl further, I realized that to trigger a continuous event.</p>
		<p>Such as </p>
		<p>“the ball hits a spike → spike disappears → ball speeds up”</p>
		<p>All related logic must be handled within the same actor. </p>
		<p>In my original code, I coded the spike to disappear when hitting by ball, and separately coded the ball to speed up when hitting a spike.
			This caused a conflict, as Stencyl could not determine which action to execute first: The spike disappearing or The ball speeding up.</p>

	<div class="AboutGame2">
		<H4>2. Fake Spike Horizontal Speed Bug</H4>
		<p> During the testing phase, I discovered sometimes that when the ball collided with a fake spike, its horizontal speed would instantly drop to zero.</p>
		<p> As a result, the ball only moved up and down in place, which heavily impacted the gameplay experience. </p>
		
		<H4>Solution</H4>
		<p>To resolve this issue, I introduced a counter system.</p>
		<p>When the ball’s horizontal speed became zero, I set a condition where after bouncing off the top or bottom walls twice, 
			the ball would be assigned a random horizontal speed.</p>
		<p>This prevented the ball from getting stuck in a vertical-only movement pattern, keeping the gameplay dynamic.</p>
